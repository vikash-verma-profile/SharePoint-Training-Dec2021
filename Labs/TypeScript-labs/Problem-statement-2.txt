To start, create a class called PhotoBook with a attribute numPages of type number. It must also have a method GetNumberPages that will return the number of photo book pages.

The default constructor will create an album with 16 pages. 
There will be an additional function, with which we can specify the number of pages we want in the album.

There is also a BigPhotoBook class whose constructor will create an album with 64 pages.


Create a default photo book and show the number of pages
Create a photo book with 24 pages and show the number of pages
Create a large photo book and show the number of pages

output 
16
