The main classes of the program are the following classes:

Person
Student
Professor

The Student and Teacher classes inherit from the Person class.

The Student class will include a Study() method that will write I'm studying on the screen.

The Person class must have two methods Greet() and SetAge(int age) that will assign the age of the person.

The Teacher class will include a Explain() method that will write I'm explaining on the screen.

Also create a method ShowAge() in the Student class that writes My age is: x years old on the screen.


output will be 

Create a new Person and make him say hello
Create a new Student, set an age, say hello, and display her age on the screen.
Create a new Teacher, set an age, say hello and start the explanation.
